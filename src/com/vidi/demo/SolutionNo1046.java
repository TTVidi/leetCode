 * @Descripton : We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
 * <p>
 * Each turn, we choose the two heaviest rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x
 * <= y.  The result of this smash is:
 * <p>
 * If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed; If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of
 * weight y has new weight y-x. At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if
 * there are no stones left.)
