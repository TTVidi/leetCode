 * @Descripton : We distribute some number of candies, to a row of n = num_people people in the following way:
 * <p>
 * We then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give n candies to the
 * last person.
 * <p>
 * Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving n + 1 candies to the first person, n + 2 candies to the second
 * person, and so on until we give 2 * n candies to the last person.
 * <p>
 * This process repeats (with us giving one more candy each time, and moving to the start of the row after we reach the
 * end) until we run out of candies.  The last person will receive all of our remaining candies (not necessarily one
 * more than the previous gift).
 * <p>
 * Return an array (of length num_people and sum candies) that represents the final distribution of candies.
