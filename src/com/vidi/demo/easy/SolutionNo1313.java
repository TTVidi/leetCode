/**
 * @program: leetCode
 * @description: Decompress Run-Length Encoded List
 * We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.
 * <p>
 * Consider each adjacent pair of elements [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with i >= 0).  For each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.
 * <p>
 * Return the decompressed list.
