 * <p>
 * Reorder Log Files
 * <p>
 * You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.
 * <p>
 * For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:
 * <p>
 * Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or; Each word after the identifier will
 * consist only of digits. We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that
 * each log has at least one word after its identifier.
 * <p>
 * Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered
 * lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in
 * their original order.
 * <p>
 * Return the final order of the logs.
