 * <p>
 * Number of Lines To Write String
 * <p>
 * We are to write the letters of a given string S, from left to right into lines. Each line has maximum width 100
 * units, and if writing a letter would cause the width of the line to exceed 100 units, it is written on the next line.
 * We are given an array widths, an array where widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', ..., and
 * widths[25] is the width of 'z'.
 * <p>
 * Now answer two questions: how many lines have at least one character from S, and what is the width used by the last
 * such line? Return your answer as an integer list of length 2.
