 * @Descripton :There are G people in a gang, and a list of various crimes they could commit.
 * <p>
 * The i-th crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] gang members to participate.
 * <p>
 * If a gang member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.
 * <p>
 * Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least P profit, and the total number of
 * gang members participating in that subset of crimes is at most G.
 * <p>
 * How many schemes can be chosen?  Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
